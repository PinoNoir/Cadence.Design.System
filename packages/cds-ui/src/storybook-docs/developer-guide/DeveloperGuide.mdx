# Getting Started

## Developer Guide

### IDE Setup (Optional)

For a better developer experience, we recommend using the latest versions of
Microsoft Visual Studio 2022 or Visual Studio Code. Reach out to your manager
if you don&apos;t have it installed on your device.

If you&apos;re already using Visual Studio/VS Code, follow these steps:

1. Open VS/VS Code and navigate to the extension marketplace.
2. Search and install the following plugins, or follow the links below to install them directly:

   - [IntelliSense for CSS class names in HTML <Icon icon="mdi:open-in-new"/>](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Zignd.html-css-class-completion 'title')
   - [CSS Var Complete <Icon icon="mdi:open-in-new"/>](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=phoenisx.cssvar 'title')
   - [Path IntelliSense <Icon icon="mdi:open-in-new"/>](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=christian-kohler.path-intellisense 'title')
   - [npm IntelliSense <Icon icon="mdi:open-in-new"/>](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=christian-kohler.npm-intellisense 'title')

### Installation

To install `@stretto/cds-ui` in your project, run the following command:

```
npm install @stretto/cds-ui[version]
```

### Import Components

Import the component from the library's root entry:

```jsx
// App.tsx
import { Button } from '@stretto/cds-ui';
```

### Customizing Component Styling

While the `@stretto/cds-ui` package does provide a set of styled components for **Debtor Attorney** applications, you may need to customize
something to fit your project's specific needs. Before making any modifications,
review the CDS guidelines and consider whether the changes align with the
design system's styling principles.

If necessary, reach out to the CDS UX Engineering team (nicholas.pino@stretto.com or barrett.grubbs@stretto.com) to propose an update to styling or introduce
a new component/variant. Feel free to create and propose a new React Typescript component that follows best practices and the
system's guidelines.

### Maintaining Consistency

One of the key benefits of a design system is ensuring consistency across
all projects. As you build your React application using CDS components,
try to follow best practices to ensure your UI is cohesive and meets CDS guidelines and industry standards.

### What if I need a component that doesn't exist in CDS?

If you are currently building with CDS React components and one isn't available for your needs,
you can utilize MUI and apply the CDS styles package.
